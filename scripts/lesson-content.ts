- Seeds can be different sizes and shapes

**Interactive Activity:**
What do you think a seed needs to start growing?
- [ ] Just water
- [ ] Just sunlight  
- [ ] Water and warmth ‚úì
- [ ] Just soil

**Stage 2: Sprout üåø**

- A tiny root grows down
- A small stem grows up

**Think About It:**
Why do you think the root grows down and the stem grows up?
- [ ] They're confused
- [ ] Root needs soil, stem needs light ‚úì
- [ ] It's just random
- [ ] They're trying to be different

**üîç Observation Challenge:**
Look around your home or classroom. Can you find any plants in different stages of their life cycle?`

    case 'Animal Life Cycles':
      return baseContent + `

**Animals Change and Grow**
Just like plants, animals go through different stages as they grow!

**Butterfly Life Cycle ü¶ã**
Let's follow a butterfly's amazing transformation:

- Sheds its skin several times

**Stage 3: Chrysalis**
- Forms a protective covering
- Amazing changes happen inside
- Can take days or weeks

**Stage 4: Butterfly**
- Emerges with beautiful wings
- Can fly and find food
- Will lay eggs to start the cycle again

**üé® Creative Activity:**
Draw the four stages of a butterfly's life cycle in order!`
